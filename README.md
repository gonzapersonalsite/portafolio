## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Immersive User Experience (UX)
- **Liquid Glass Interface:** Cutting-edge visual style inspired by visionOS, featuring advanced glassmorphism and neon accents.
- **Interactive Project Gallery:** full-screen viewer with captions, a thumbnail strip, zoom up to 4× (buttons, click or keyboard) and keyboard navigation (arrows, +/−, 0).
- **Theme Engine:** Light, Dark and the exclusive Liquid Glass mode. The site follows the operating system until the visitor picks a theme, and paints the right background before the app loads.
- **Dynamic Localization:** full bilingual support (English/Spanish) with instant interface and content translation. Adding `?lang=es` to any address shares the page in Spanish.

### 📦 Content as Data
- **Static JSON content model:** projects, skills, experience, profile, and spoken languages live in versioned JSON files — no CMS, no API, no database. Adding a project is a data change, not a code change.
- **Self-hosted assets:** every image, icon and font (Inter) is served from the site itself — zero third-party image or font hosts.
- **Contact form:** powered by EmailJS (browser-only, no backend required), loaded only when a message is sent.
- **Responsive Design:** fluid layouts optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Animated Backgrounds:** high-performance CSS animations for a modern, interactive feel.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Principles

The project follows a modern **static frontend architecture**, prioritizing maintainability, performance, and zero operational cost.

- **Feature-Sliced Frontend:** 6-layer FSD architecture (`app/`, `pages/`, `widgets/`, `features/`, `entities/`, `shared/`) with strict import boundaries enforced by ESLint.
- **Static Content Model:** bilingual content in JSON per entity, validated by data-integrity tests.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Vercel deploys every push to `main`; GitHub Actions runs lint, tests and the production build on every change.
- **Agent-Readable Output & SEO:** one HTML page per route with its own metadata and JSON-LD structured data, plus `llms.txt`, robots/sitemap and English/Spanish markdown twins per route, all generated at build time from the same JSON content.
- **Security Headers:** a strict Content-Security-Policy (the only inline script is allowed by its hash) and the usual hardening headers on every response.
